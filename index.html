      <h2>Principles</h2>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>Care about your work, about other members, and about yourself. Don't stand by while another member struggles. Best results come when we work together effectively. We succeed only if we help each other succeed.</li><br>
          <li>Work at the edge of your abilities. Be ambitious about what you can achieve and also honest about your capacity, choosing work that challenges you but isn't so far beyond your current abilities that it's discouraging. This is where the most learning and growth happens. Dare mighty things! Perseverance is your friend.</li><br>
          <li>Be empathetic. EQ is as important, if not more important, than IQ. Importantly, EQ includes self-empathy.</li><br>
          <li>Have substance. Make claims and have strong opinions, but back them up with strong evidence.</li><br>
          <li>Build your volitional muscles. Grow your ability to make decisions about your work and learning based on your own curiosity and joy, rather than external pressures and fears. This enables you to discover what you deeply care about, independent of what society, your family, or financial necessity might pressure you to do. </li><br>
          <li>Question. Don't go straight for the answer. The art of success is in asking good questions. A well-posed question may unveil a simpler solution.</li><br>
          <li>Be humble. Arrogance is blinding. Humility is key to solving problems with unexpected solutions.</li><br>
          <li>Learn generously. That's what makes Moonshot a community. We celebrate each other's successes, support each other when we struggle, and benefit from each other's knowledge. Learning generously takes many forms. It means sharing your curiosities, interests, and struggles with others; being open to collaboration; and listening well and asking good questions when others share their work with you. If you're very social and enjoy variety, it might mean hosting events or pairing on other people's projects. If you're afraid you can't learn generously because you have less experience, don't be. Even if some people know more than you about specific topics, your enthusiasm and excitement for what you're learning might be exactly what inspires someone else to push through a slump. Learning generously works best if everyone does it. When we do, we all get out more than we put in.</li><br>
          <li>Be responsible individually and as a community. To the world and to ourselves.</li><br>
          <li>Have courageous conversations. Be brave. Give each other honest feedback when there is a problem. These conversations diversify thinking and enhance empathy.</li><br>
          <li>Disagree and commit. Consensus is cozy, but broad agreement is not our aim. The right decision is. Which is why we take the time to think, debate, persuade, listen and reconsider and then, someone, decides. If you disagree, that's fine, but once the decision is made, it's time to commit and support it completely.</li><br>
          <li>Know no. "No" is no to one thing. "Yes" is no to a lot of things.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
